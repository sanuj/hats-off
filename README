"H.A.T.S.of.F." stands for "Home Automation for syncronisation of Facebook". It aims for wireless control of electrical appliances using Facebook. Currently we are using the user's Facebook Status Updates to control the appliances, for example if the user's status update says "on" then the appliance will get switched on. This will also require some hardware components connected to the appliances. Don't worry if you don't have the hardware components, you can still look at all your facebook statuses by clicking a button after you login. Please don't hesitate to login with Facebook because we will not be getting your passwords and we won't be posting anything on your behalf. This project is still under development, we will be adding more features as soon as possible.
